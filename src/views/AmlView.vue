        In the process of due diligence and KYC and in order to open an account,

        Monitoring, risk assessment and risk-based approach
      </h5>
      <p class="aml-policy__text">
        Nex carries out customer’s transactions monitoring, risk‐assessment and
        suspicious activity detection. For that purpose it uses specially
        developed system, including using a high-performance tools.

        Nex uses risk-based approach to combating/preventing money laundry
        and/or financing terrorism.
      </p>
      <p class="aml-policy__text">
        To assist in determining the level of AML/CFT due diligence to be
        exercised with regard to the customer, a compliance risk profile is
        calculated first of all on entry into relations (Low, Medium, High), and
        is then recalculated routinely.
      </p>
      <p class="aml-policy__text">
        AML/CFT compliance ensures that an ongoing transaction monitoring is
        conducted to detect transactions which are unusual or suspicious
        compared to the customer profile.
      </p>
      <p class="aml-policy__text">
        Determination of the unusual nature of one or more transactions
        essentially depends on a subjective assessment, in relation to the
        knowledge of the customer (KYC), their financial behaviour and the
        transaction counterparty.
      </p>
      <p class="aml-policy__text">
        If a transaction is inconsistent with a customer’s known personal usual
        activities or personal habits, this transaction may be considered
        suspicious. Data and transaction monitoring tools are used to identify
        unusual/uncommon patterns of customer’s activity. After review and
        investigation, it is Compliance Officer’s decision whether to file a SAR
        or not.
      </p>
      <p class="aml-policy__text">
        Once a SAR is filed with a relevant agency, a copy of filing
        documentation is maintained. SAR filing is confidential and only the
        WhiteBIT’s employees involved in the investigation and reporting process
        will be aware of its existence.
      </p>
      <p class="aml-policy__text">
        All records are retained for no less than (5) years and are available
        upon official request by an authorized examiner, regulator, or law
        enforcement agency.
      </p>
      <p class="aml-policy__text">
        Any Nex staff member must inform the Compliance Officer of any atypical
        transactions which they observe and cannot attribute to a lawful
        activity or source of income known of the customer.

        Information about our users is an important part of our business and we
        are not in the business of selling our users' personal information to
        others. Nex shares users' personal information only as described below

        to this Privacy Notice or follow practices at least as protective as
        those described in this Privacy Notice.

        Third party service providers: We employ other companies and individuals
        to perform functions on our behalf. Examples include analysing data,
        providing marketing assistance, processing payments, transmitting
        content, and assessing and managing credit risk. These third-party
        service providers only have access to personal information needed to
        perform their functions, but may not use it for other purposes. Further,
        they must process the personal information in accordance with our
        contractual agreements and only as permitted by applicable data
        protection laws.

        Business transfers: As we continue to develop our business, we might

        information generally is one of the transferred business assets but
        remains subject to the promises made in any pre-existing Privacy Notice
        (unless, of course, the user consents otherwise). Also, in the unlikely
        event that Nex or substantially all of its assets are acquired, user
        information will be one of the transferred assets. Protection of Nex and
        others: We release account and other personal information when we
        believe release is appropriate to comply with the law or with our
        regulatory obligations; enforce or apply our Terms of Use and other
        agreements; or protect the rights, property or safety of Binance, our

        transferred has already been determined by the European Commission to
        provide an adequate level of protection.
